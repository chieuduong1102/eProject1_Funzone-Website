Petra lies around Jabal Al-Madbah in a basin surrounded by mountains which form the eastern flank of the Arabah valley that runs from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and the Nabataeans might have settled in what would become the capital city of their kingdom, as early as the 4th century BC. However, archaeological work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the second century BC, by which time Petra had become their capital. The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra\'s proximity to the trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub.'),

And though Shakespeare, the master poet of romance, once referred to music as the ‚Äúfood of love‚Äù, he went much further, writing that music has the power to create art as well as to destroy life.\r\nOur restaurant concept is formed in harmony with the rhythms of the King‚Äôs Symphony, showcasing an orchestra of Vietnamese authentic cuisine embellished with the grandeur of royal ambience. The blending of sophisticated Western architecture with local heritage has created a beautiful melody, expected to touch the emotion of guests and take them on a unique sensory journey.\r\nOur dream for The DVT Restaurant is to capture the charm of local cuisine and elevate it to an upper standard with compassion and creativity. The development of our upcoming restaurants is expected to cultivate a harmonious society where both locals and international friends can embrace, cherish and spread the taste of Vietnamese cuisine throughout the region.');
